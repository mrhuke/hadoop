The code is hosted at http://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/. You can find code
for the first edition at http://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/tree/1e.

This version of the code has been tested with:
 * Hadoop 0.20.2
 * Pig 0.7.0
 * Hive 0.5.0-dev (compiled from SVN trunk)
 * HBase 0.89.0-SNAPSHOT (compiled from SVN trunk)
 * ZooKeeper 3.3.1.

Before running the examples you need to install Hadoop, Pig, Hive, HBase,
and ZooKeeper as explained in the book.

You also need to install Ivy (http://ant.apache.org/ivy/).

Then you can compile the code:

ant jar pig hive hbase

You should then be able to run the examples from the book.
